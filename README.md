##### üö© Introduction
C√°i repo : `draw`, `img_draw`, `other`, `img_other`, `function`, and `web`. However, you can ignore the `web` folder.

**DETAILS:**
1. The `draw` and `other` folders contain **source code** files.
  
2. The `img_draw` and `img_other` folders hold **images of the expected output**. Additionally, there are **executable files (.exe)** in the sub-folder `output` to aid you in testing the output of the code. This helps in identifying and matching the source code more easily.

3. The `draw` folder has problems related to **drawing**, while the `other` folder features problems **not related to drawing**.

4. The `function` folder provides some functions. You might need them if your tests don't align with the source.

5. The `web` folder stores website data. This website assists you in looking up knowledge and its functional commands.

3. Locate the corresponding file number in the `draw` or `other` folders to find the related source code.
4. The `function` folder can be used as usual.
